Hey,

My code is very very not DRY. The reason it is this way is that this is the first site ive made using SASS and I ran into some ridiculous specificity problems. I ended up scrapping my entire site's CSS because it got to the point that selectors were just too much to handle. This isnt an excuse but just explaining why things are the way they are. I wanted to have a finished product and this was the quickest way for me to achieve that after the issues. 

On the bright side I learned a lot about nesting and selectors in SASS and I also learned why BEM can be awesome because you can have crazy specifity with only one "level" of selector depth!

Thanks for looking at my project!
